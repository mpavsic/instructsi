Prof. Marjetka Podobnik (National Institute of Chemistry) and Prof. Kristina Djinović-Carugo (EMBL Grenoble) gave a presentation of Instruct-ERIC consortium at the [15th Meeting of the Slovenian Biochemical Society](https://portoroz2023.sbd.si) that was held in Portorož, Slovenia, from 20th to 23rd of September 2023. The meeting covered various fields, ranging from biochemistry to biotechnology, including structural biology, with participation of established as well as young researchers from all major research and educational institutions. Therefore, the meeting was an excellent opportunity to present the possibilities enabled to researchers from Slovenia by the [recent joining of Slovenia to the Instruct-ERIC consortium](2023-05-10-slovenia_joins_instruct-eric.md).
